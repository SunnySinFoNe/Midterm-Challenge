            <p class="items1"> Coder's Note: This (referring to the document above) was originally going to be linked under the "About Madame P" box, but the link wasn't working because I was trying to put it in as a PDF, so I just embedded it onto the page. I also couldn't figure out how to center said document. And there's a couple of other things I probably didn't do.</p>
